  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 14, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our GPT or any related services under the domain <strong>homeplatedm.com</strong>.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not directly collect personal data such as names or email addresses unless you voluntarily provide it. Some information (such as general usage statistics or technical logs) may be collected automatically by OpenAI or third-party hosting services to operate and improve functionality.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>Any data collected is used only to enhance service quality, monitor performance, and ensure compliance with platform policies. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>GitHub Pages and OpenAI may use cookies or analytics tools to track aggregate usage data. You can disable cookies in your browser settings if you prefer.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>This GPT may connect to external APIs or data providers (such as government open-data portals). These services operate under their own privacy policies, and we encourage users to review them separately.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet-based service can guarantee complete security.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy periodically. The most recent version will always be available at this URL with the effective date shown at the top.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
